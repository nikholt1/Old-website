    <p>small portable wifi detector</p>
    <div class="dobbydrop">
        <button class="dobbybutton" onclick="toggleDobbyContent()">The Project</button>
        <div class="dobbycontent">
            <p><p>DOBBY is a small Raspberry Pi Zero W-powered device, capable of WiFi MAC sniffing.
                The Raspberry Pi Zero W, flashed with Raspberry Kali Linux, is soldered with a Pimoroni four-letter PHAT display.
                The device is plugged with a LILYGO LoRa 32 network, making it possible to deploy the DOBBY device out of LOS. Built so compact that it can be attached to a drone or another transport device, the LoRa will send a message of how many devices have been found in the area where DOBBY is.</p>
                
                <p>DOBBY "start" runs on a Python program that is started through a bash file, keybinded to the far-left button. Through the Python program, it takes the messages that the program returns and counts how many devices it has detected. After processing the detected devices in a count, the same Python program runs a new command in the terminal automatically, sending a message from the LoRa attached to DOBBY, to the LoRa by the operator.
                The program is by default programmed by me to not decrypt the MAC addresses of the devices, making it possible to simply locate device activity in the area and/or through the GPS position time log and device capture time log heatmap the activity with an after-action data review.
                With the directional antenna, DOBBY can detect device activity up to over 20 km away. The directional antenna is a 2.4 GHz cut silver antenna with a WiFi dongle soldered to it.
                the antenna is still under production.</p>
                
                <p>THE RUN:
                After bootup, DOBBY will show a start screen presenting itself followed by a single dot on the PHAT. The single dot indicates that DOBBY is ready for a run. By pressing the far-left button, DOBBY will display "RUN" followed by "LOAD" and/or "ERR" if there are some error messages. "LOAD" indicates that the program is running and is being set up to start the WiFi dongle in monitor mode. "FATL" indicates a fatal error, which results in a program shutdown.
                After "LOAD," DOBBY will display a count from 1 to (infinite) showing how many devices have been detected.
                The program is capable of logging the detected devices in a .kismet or .png file, as well as the GPS position logged in time.
                While DOBBY runs, the LoRa is powered up and if the LoRa is connected to another LoRa (by the operator) it will send the detected devices count to the remote operator.</p>
                
                <p>DOBBY is a proof of concept, made for WiFi activity alerting. DOBBY's first purpose is to find missing people together with a drone and/or a search party in remote environments.
                DOBBY is made by me with the help of a few others and is simply a project of interest, not intended for illegal purposes.</p>

        <p>portable fake eNodeBs detector</p>    
        <div class="reviliodrop">

            <button class="reviliobutton" onclick="toggleRevilioContent()">The Project</button>
            <div class="reviliocontent">
                <p>Revilio is a Raspberry Pi 4-powered fake eNodeBs detector.
                    Revilio runs on Raspberry Dragon OS software with Crocodile Hunter 
                    from EFForg installed. Revilio's purpose is to detect and alert the user
                    of fake eNodeBs activity. With the 2.4 GHz directional antenna, Revilio is 
                    capable of detecting the direction of the fake eNodeBs, aka. stingray.
                    Therefore, Revilio is also called a Crocodile Hunter. 
                    Revilio is a portable wardriven Crocodile Hunter capable of finding stingray
                    system operators. 
                    With Revilio running, the operator will be able to triangulate the position of 
                    the stingray.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Run:
                    Revilio is still in the process of being built.</p>
                    
                    <p>REVILIO:
                    Revilio is still a project to be made. The plan is to run CH from EFF on the DOS system
                    and display it with a small soldered 16-bit LCD display. Other hardware like USB-connected antennas
                    are still being found.
                    The program will most likely be run through Python, and alerts and other functions will be 
                    displayed on the LCD Display.</p>
